       ## "run_analysis.R" creates tidy data for the data from wearable computing device


###steps followed :		

*[1]loading the "dplyr" data frame 

*[2]pulling in the data from the test folder into data frames

*[3]pulling in the data from the train folder into data frames

*[4]getting the names of the variable and putting it in the vector named "name"

*[5]proving these variable names to the both the data frames testdata and train data

*[6]creating two new factor that provide descriptive names of the activities

*[7]putting the subject or volunteer numbers into two vectors

*[8]cbinding the corresponding subject number and activities two each train and test data

*[9]giving same name to the first two columns of both the data before rbinding 

*[10]rbinding and getting the total observations

*[11]temporarily storing the first two columns of the complete set

*[12]selecting only those column the involve mean() or std()

*[13]changing the variable "Activity"'s class from factor to character to avoid complications later
 
*[14]for the last step of the project , splitting the complete and temp_complete by temp_complete

*[15]by sapplying , doing column means on one list and choosing the first row form each member of the second list
  
*[16]rbinding both to get the total data 

*[17]transposing to get variables in the columns 

*[18]proving proper row numbers 

*[19]variable "j" has the final result so saving it into tidy.txt file
